# Full Reactive Stack

This project contains a backend and a frontend applications that together make use of Reactive Web patterns.

## Spring Boot Reactive Web

This is a Spring Boot 2.0 application that retrieves data using Spring Reactive Web (WebFlux), instead of using the
standard synchronous MVC framework.

## Angular Reactive

This simple Angular JS application consumes the controller on the backend side using a reactive approach, so data is
loaded on screen as soon as it's available.
