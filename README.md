# Full Reactive Stack

This repository contains backend and frontend projects that make use of **Reactive Web** patterns,
as explained in the [Full Reactive Stack](https://thepracticaldeveloper.com/category/guides/full-reactive-stack/)
series of posts.

## Spring Boot Reactive Web

This is a Spring Boot 2.0 application that retrieves data using **Spring Reactive Web (WebFlux)**,
instead of using the standard synchronous MVC framework.

Check [this post](https://thepracticaldeveloper.com/2017/11/04/full-reactive-stack-with-spring-webflux-and-angularjs/)
for more details about the implementation.

## Angular Reactive

This simple Angular JS application consumes the controller on the backend side using a reactive approach
(Server-Sent Events), so data is loaded on screen as soon as it's available.
